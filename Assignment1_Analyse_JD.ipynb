        "\n",
        "3. **\"CTC\" (Cost to Company)**:\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **\"notice_period\"**:\n",
        "    - **Explanation**: Note the notice period details from the job description. If this information is absent, it should be marked as \"none\".\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **\"educational_requirement\"**:\n",
        "    - **Explanation**: The user is to find and state the educational requirements mentioned in the job description. In the absence of this information, it should be reported as \"none\".\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **\"technical_summary\"**:\n",

        "\n",
        "8. **\"must_have_skills\"**:\n",
        "    - **Explanation**: Identify and list the skills clearly labeled as essential or \"must-have\" in the job description, noting them in the \"must_have_skills\" field.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **\"location\"**:\n",
        "    - **Explanation**: Find the job location from the job description and mention it in the \"location\" field. If not specified, it should be mentioned as \"none\".\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Instruction on Output Format**:\n",

        "\n",
        "In this refined prompt, you have added a directive at the beginning, instructing clearly to \"Return to me in json format\", which sets a clear expectation for the kind of output you are looking for, thereby reducing the scope for ambiguous outputs. This makes it more explicit and straightforward, guiding the GPT model to align the output exactly as per your format requirements. It instructs a structured representation of various details extracted from a job description in a JSON format, which ensures a clear and organized presentation of the information."
